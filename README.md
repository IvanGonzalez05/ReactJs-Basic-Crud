# ReactJs Basic Crud

The purpose of this project was to learn the basics of the Context API to manage state on a React app.
This project is a very simple one. Is a CRUD where you can manage simple series data as name, author and its release date.

Since the main goal of the project was to learn the Context API, I did not use a database to store data. Instead I used an 
array of objects with some pre-defined series so that the app renders some things at first
